# Bria Fibo

Text-to-image models have mastered imagination - but not control. FIBO changes that.

FIBO is trained on structured JSON captions up to 1,000+ words and designed to understand and control different visual parameters such as lighting, composition, color, and camera settings, enabling precise and reproducible outputs.

With only 8 billion parameters, FIBO provides a new level of image quality, prompt adherence and proffesional control.

## Usage

_As the model is gated, before using it with diffusers you first need to go to the [Bria Fibo Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/briaai/FIBO), fill in the form and accept the gate. Once you are in, you need to login so that your system knows youâ€™ve accepted the gate._

Use the command below to log in:

```bash
hf auth login
```
