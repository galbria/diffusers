# Bria 3.2

Bria 3.2 is the next-generation commercial-ready text-to-image model. With just 4 billion parameters, it provides exceptional aesthetics and text rendering, evaluated to provide on par results to leading open-source models, and outperforming other licensed models.
In addition to being built entirely on licensed data, 3.2 provides several advantages for enterprise and commercial use:

- Efficient Compute - the model is X3 smaller than the equivalent models in the market (4B parameters vs 12B parameters other open source models)
- Architecture Consistency: Same architecture as 3.1â€”ideal for users looking to upgrade without disruption.
- Fine-tuning Speedup: 2x faster fine-tuning on L40S and A100.

## Inference


```python
import torch
from diffusers import BriaPipeline

pipe = BriaPipeline.from_pretrained("briaai/BRIA-3.2",revision="bria_3_2_diffusers", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = "A high-fashion close-up portrait of a blonde woman in clear sunglasses. The image uses a bold teal and red color split for dramatic lighting. The background is a simple teal-green. The photo is sharp and well-composed, and is designed for viewing with anaglyph 3D glasses for optimal effect. It looks professionally done."

image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("bria.png")
